# tic-tac-toe

This is a pretty big project.

I am going to use the web dev simplified tutorial as a reference and help
in creating this project. I will first tackle the css and html as those are not the biggest thing I am trying to learn. The big focus is to have as little global variables as possible and to really try and make this project built using OOP.
